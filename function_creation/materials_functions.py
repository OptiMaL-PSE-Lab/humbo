            Sun visible only illumination is applied to enable automatic image capture every 5 min using an RGB camera (~200 Œºm resolution).

            We hence used a color-based metric as a proxy to capture the macroscopic evolution of the high-band-gap, 
            non-perovskite phases. We define the instability index as the integrated color change of an unencapsulated perovskite film over accelerated degradation test duration T. 
            the instability index is a function of time, area-averaged, color-calibrated red, green, and blue pixel values of the sample. 
            The cutoff time was set to T = 7,000 min based on the observed divergence between the most- and least-stable compositions.

        By adjusting the flow rate of the solvent (water), the flow rate ratios Qseed of silver seeds, ùëÑAgNO3 of silver nitrate, QTSC of trisodium citrate and QPVA of PVA are independently controlled by varying the flow rate of the corresponding solutions using LabView automated syringe pumps. 
        The flow rate ratio QAA of ascorbic acid is kept constant. 
        The mixing of the reactants inside the droplet depends on the speed of the droplet, which is directly proportional to the total flow rate Qtotal (¬µL/min) of both oil and aqueous phases. 
        The absorbance spectra of the droplets are measured inline, and the five controlled variables Qseed, ùëÑAgNO3, QTSC, QPVA and Qtotal are used as input parameters for the two-step optimization framework and the absorbance spectra as the output.

        In each experiment, AM ARES printed a 12 mm line and captured an image of the leading segment. 
        An image analysis module returned a single ‚Äòobjective score‚Äô based on the two-dimensional size, shape, and location of the printed feature. 
        Here, the target shape for the leading segment of printed lines was defined as a combined rectangle and semi-circle. 
        To elucidate the effectiveness of the optimization process, we intentionally set the conditions so as to be relatively challenging: 
        We selected a 0.42 mm dispensing tip, and the target shape for the leading segment was almost three times wider at w‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.2 mm.
        We formulated an objective-scoring algorithm that returned the quotient of the effective specimen area divided by the desired region‚Äôs area.
        The effective area is defined as the area of the specimen internal to the desired region less the area of the specimen external to the desired region.
        Negative values for effective area are set to zero. 
        An ideal print, wherein the outline is completely filled without any specimen external to the outline, would achieve a maximal objective score of 1.0.
        The objective is to maximise this score.

        Toughness is difficult to optimize because it requires maximizing a combination of two properties that tend to be inversely correlated, namely, strength and ductility.

        which makes it an important property to optimize in the context of design for safety and failure tolerance.

        The general shape optimised is a crossed barrel, consisting of two flat disks, between which are a number of struts. 
        Parameter information: n denotes the number of struts between the two disks that are being compressed, 
        t is the thickness of each strut, r is the inner radius of each strut.
        theta denotes a twist of the struts, enabling them to cross over.

        It has already been reported that doping increases the electrical conductivity of all P3HT/CNT composites irrespective of the type of CNTs.
        The workflow begins with data generation from the high-throughput experimental platform, where P3HT/CNT composite films are prepared in a microfluidic reactor linked to an automated drop-casting system, then transitions to rapid optical, and electrical diagnostics.
        In this study, we mix rr-P3HT with four types of CNTs, where the interactions between the P3HT chains and CNTs are expected to create different morphologies and crystalline structures that control the electrical conductivity of the composite film. 
        The types of CNTs used in this study are: 1) long single wall CNTs of lengths in the range of 5‚Äì30 ¬µm (l-SWNTs), 2) short single wall CNTs of lengths in the range of 1‚Äì3¬µm, (s-SWNTs), 3) multi walled CNTs (MWCNTs), and 4) double-walled CNTs (DWCNTs). 
        The choice of the nanotubes was aimed to cover a broad range of properties.
